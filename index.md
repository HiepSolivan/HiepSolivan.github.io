### CPSC 120

* [Lab 7](https://github.com/HiepSolivan/CPSC-120-Lab-7)

    Lab 7 Part 1 was an interesting comeback to a previous lab we did in CPSC 120L where we found the difference between dates via a conversion to Julian dates. I liked Lab 7 for its interesting spin on this idea by requiring command-line arguments.  
    Lab 7 was my introduction to using vectors and command line arguments and was quite the exercise! In the lab, I converted strings provided by the user to integers that would represent a date. In the end, a satisfying date difference was provided.

* [Lab 8](https://github.com/HiepSolivan/CPSC-120-Lab-8)

    Lab 8 Part 2 served as my introduction to range-based for loops. The primary challenge of the lab was to find a way to skip the first elementâ€“ the output file. I solved this issue by uniquely using a type bool: it was used to continue the loop and was then subsequently switched off. I liked the challenge of shifting away from the use of a standard for loop (which I initially attempted) to a more convenient one for each loop.

* [Lab 11](https://github.com/HiepSolivan/CPSC-120-Lab-11)

    Lab 11 Part 2 dealt with creating a number-guessing game using a random number generator. I was initially confused about the inner workings of the generator (how to call and seed it), but once I found my footing, the process was streamlined. The lab also built my understanding of constructors. This lab is one of my favorites as it marked a shift to a more pre-built program with little user input.
